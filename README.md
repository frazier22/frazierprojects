I am currently in the process of transitioning projects from Perforce to Github. Below I have google drive links to the built versions of some personal projects. If you would like to request the unbuilt Unity project version, to see files, look at assets + code, then email me at ryanfraz@usc.edu, or text at (310) 874-2226. Thanks for your interest!

                         current pandemic climate. If necessary, contact me and I can send you the prototype demos.\
