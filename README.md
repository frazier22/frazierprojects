# frazierprojects
I am currently in the process of transitioning projects from Perforce to Github. Below I have google drive links to the built versions of some personal projects. If you would like to request any unbuilt project to see files + look at assets and code, then email me at ryanfraz@usc.edu, or text at (310) 874-2226. Thanks for your interest! 

Feâˆ€R VR and Galaxy Room: I am waiting for the re-opening of public libraries to upload these VR experiences. The finished projects are unfortunately contained on a library PC not accessible to students during this pandemic. If you would like, contact me and I can send prototype versions.\
