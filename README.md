I am currently in the process of transitioning projects from Perforce to Github. Below I have google drive links to the built versions of some of my projects. If you would like to request the unbuilt Unity project version, to look at assets and code, please send me an email at ryanfraz@usc.edu, or text me at (310) 874-2226. Thanks for your interest!

                         current pandemic climate. If necessary, contact me and I can send you the prototype demos.\
